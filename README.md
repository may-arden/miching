welcome! inspired by brian eno's oblique strategies & the ancient practice of the i ching, miching is a cleromancy application for early music enthusiasts

description: choose a genre from the list, hold your breath & wait a moment as
the machine determines by random selection which bach composition within that category will suite your mood 

getting started: in your terminal, make sure you are in the project's main directory. enter 'bundle install' & when that is complete enter './bin/miching' & let the program work its magic. the program automatically terminates after you've made your selection & the machine has delivered its response

thank you OpenOpus.org for curating such a friendly & comprehensive application programming interface
